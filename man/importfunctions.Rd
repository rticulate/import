\item{.from}{The package from which to import.}

If arguments are named, then the imported object will have this new name.}

into the current environment.}

the latest specified library.}

\description{
The \code{import::from} and \code{import::into} functions provide an
alternative way to import objects (e.g. functions) from packages. It is
sometimes preferred over using \code{library} (or \code{require}) which will
import all objects exported by the package. The benefit over \code{obj <-
pkg::obj} is that the imported objects will (by default) be placed in a
separate entry in the search path (which can be specified), rather in the
global/current environment. Also, it is a more succinct way of importing
several objects. Note that the two functions are symmetric, and usage is a
matter of preference and whether specifying the \code{.into} argument is
desired. The function \code{import::here} is short-hand for
\code{import::from} with \code{.into = ""} which imports into the current
environment.
}
\details{
The function arguments can be quoted or unquoted as with e.g. \code{library}.
In any case, the character representation is used when unquoted arguments are
provided (and not the value of objects with matching names). The period in
the argument names \code{.into} and \code{.from} are there to avoid name
clash with package objects. The double-colon syntax \code{import::from}
allows for imports of exported objects (and lazy data) only. To import
objects that are not exported, use triple-colon syntax, e.g.
\code{import:::from}. The two ways of calling the \code{import} functions
analogue the \code{::} and \code{:::} operators themselves.

Note that the \code{import} functions usually have the (intended) side-effect
of altering the search path, as they (by default) import objects into the
"imports" search path entry rather than the global environment.

The \code{import} package is not meant to be loaded with \code{library} (and
will output a message about this if attached), but rather it is named to make
the function calls expressive without the need to preload, i.e. it is
designed to be used explicitly with the \code{::} syntax, e.g.
\code{import::from(pkg, x, y)}.
