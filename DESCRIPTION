Title: An Import Mechanism for R
Version: 1.1.9000

Description: This is an alternative mechanism for importing
    objects from packages. The syntax allows for importing multiple objects
    from a package with a single command in an expressive way. The import
    package bridges some of the gap between using library (or require) and
    direct (single-object) imports. Furthermore the imported objects are not
    placed in the current environment.
