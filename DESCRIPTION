Title: An Import Mechanism for R
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Stefan Milton Bache
Maintainer: Stefan Milton Bache <stefan@stefanbache.dk>
Description: This is an alternative mechanism for importing
  objects from packages. The syntax allows for importing multiple objects
  from a package with a single command in an expressive way. The import
  package bridges some of the gap between using library (or require) and
  direct (single-object) imports. Furthermore the imported objects are not
  placed in the current environment.
